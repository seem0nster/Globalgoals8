      <h1>US - North Problems and Somutions</h1>
      <p>Global employment policy members hear every day from member companies of every size and industry across nearly every state- theyâ€™re facing unprecedented challenges trying to find enough workers to fill open jobs. The latest data shows that we have 9.5 million job openings in Northern U.S, but only 6.5 million unemployed workers. We have jobs open, but not enough workers to fill them. If every unemployed person in the country found a job, we would still have nearly 3 million open jobs. </p>
